abstract: This paper presents an assessment of emerging livestock-based
  greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation schemes that link the uptake of
  environmentally beneficial breeding practices to carbon offset schemes. Using
  the example of genomic selection for feed efficiency by cattle producers in
  Alberta Canada, we explored the potential effect of spatial heterogeneity on
  producer incentive to participate in these schemes. We model three
  representative cow-calf operations in three agroecological zones and
  incorporate region specific breeding, economic and environmental factors. Our
  results show that environmental and economic outcomes differ spatially, and
  that the additional revenue from the existing offset scheme is inadequate to
  incentivize producers in specific regions. The priority for policy makers is
  to implement a differential payment scheme that accounts for specific sources
  of spatial heterogeneity in environmental and economic tradeoffs.
