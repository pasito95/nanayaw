abstract: Farm animal welfare (FAW) issues are becoming increasingly political
  in many countries, as evidenced by the increased use of regulations,
  legislation, and ballot initiatives. Available empirical evidence however,
  indicates that consumer valuation of improved animal welfare is low, although
  positive. As a result of the sensitive nature of FAW issues, public
  preferences for improved FAW standards can be susceptible to social
  desirability bias leading to disparities between regulatory standards and the
  public’s “true” preferences. Given the potential negative impacts of high
  mandated FAW standards on food costs and the associated consumer and producer
  welfare losses, this study examined the issue of effective public preference
  elicitation in animal welfare ballot initiatives. Specifically, we examined
  social desirability, the tendency to conform to the social norms, and its role
  in generating overenthusiasm in the support for FAW issues and policy
  instruments. We used data from an opt-in survey of respondents and compared
  results of a List Experiments (LE) to a conventional (direct) survey format.
  Our results show that public support for the FAW issues examined was
  consistently overestimated when elicited with the conventional survey format.
  We discuss the implications of these outcomes for animal welfare policy and
  offer suggestions to researchers and practitioners eliciting preferences in
  other sensitive food policy contexts.
