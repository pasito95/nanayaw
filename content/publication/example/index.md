abstract: This paper explores the potential market opportunities and challenges
  facing the commercialization of wastewater aquaculture systems in Peru. Peru
  produces large volumes of wastewater that can be reused to produce fish.
  However, the long-term sustainability of wastewater aquaculture value chains
  requires an understanding of consumer preferences and perceptions about
  product, market and institutional factors. We focus on the role of consumers
  in wastewater fish value chains and their preferences for different quality
  and regulatory attributes. The study utilizes data from a field survey
  conducted in Lima, Peru. A multi-stage stratified sampling technique was used
  to interview 443 households. A choice experiment was conducted as part of the
  data collection. Fish attributes analyzed included price, certification, and
  source. Data on householdsâ€™ health and environmental perceptions, and trust in
  regulatory institutions were also collected. The empirical results indicate
  that household perceptions about the quality of wastewater fish differs by
  marketing source. We find a strong preference for direct marketing channels.
  We also find that concerns about the safety of wastewater fish is at the
  forefront of household considerations. Willingness to pay for wastewater fish
  was positive but lower than wild and freshwater fish.
