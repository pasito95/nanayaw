  This paper aims to synthesize the literature on consumer preferences for farm
  animal welfare (FAW), with an emphasis on characterizing consumers based on
  their FAW preferences. The objective is to provide insights into the salient
  characteristics associated with animal welfare conscious consumers.The authors
  conduct a systematic review of the results of published research on consumer
  preferences for FAW. Approximately 350 papers were reviewed, and 52 were
  included in the analysis.The authors’ review suggests that consumers are not
  homogenous in their preferences for FAW. The authors identify seven themes
  that enabled them to characterize consumers with higher FAW preferences. These
  themes (i.e. age, education and income, gender, country and cross-cultural
  differences, attitudes and consumer and citizen functions) are grouped under
  four main headings (socio-demographics, ethics and attitudes, product
  characteristics and public roles).The authors’ synthesis reflects the findings
  reported in the literature to this date; the identified characteristics may
  change with time as new evidence becomes available.The information collected
  in this article would be useful to farmers and food and non-food retailers
  interested in effective product differentiation and marketing strategies
  regarding FAW standards. It can also inform policymakers about the state of
  consumer concerns for FAW.


  Originality/value

  To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to develop a systematic profile of consumers based on their FAW preferences.
