abstract: The growing popularity of plant-based milk alternatives suggests a
  shift in consumer preferences for dairy and nondairy products. Drivers of
  these shifts include rising concerns for environmental sustainability and farm
  animal welfare (FAW). Using data from a field survey, this study examines how
  primary purchasing motivations regarding health, nutrition, environment, and
  FAW worldviews (a focus on perceptions of calf housing) influence consumer
  choice of dairy milk, plant-based milk alternatives, and soda. We also explore
  parentâ€“child consumption patterns within a given household. Our results show
  that as compared to the baseline of price sensitive consumers, respondents who
  were primarily concerned about health, FAW, and the environment were more
  likely to purchase and consume plant-based milk alternatives more frequently.
  We find consistencies in the consumption patterns between youth and parents
  within households; however, the substitution effects of FAW worldviews on
  these consumption patterns differed. The implications of these findings for
  the fluid milk industry are discussed.
